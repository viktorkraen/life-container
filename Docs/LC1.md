# Container Storage Path ðŸ“‚

# PC ðŸ’»
If you are working on a personal computer, you can store the container anywhere you like, but it is recommended to keep it in the user's root folder (for example, `~/Users/YourName/` on `Mac` or `C:/Users/YourName/` on `Windows`).

# Mobile ðŸ“±
If you are also working on a mobile device, you can store the container anywhere you like, but it is recommended to keep it in the device's root folder (on `IOS`, keep the container directly in the device's root folder, which is stored at the highest level. On `Android`, also store the container in the file manager at the root folder level of the device).

# Why? ðŸ¤”
This will allow you to access the container at the highest level, as it was designed to replace any OS folder structure with a more symbolic one that any person can understand.
